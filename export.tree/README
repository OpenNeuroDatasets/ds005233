***********************************
*    Regarding Functional Scans   *
***********************************
Structural scans are in the folder "func" for each subject.

Resting state scans are called "sub-N_ses-1_task-restingstate_run-1_bold" where "N" is the subject number.

Noiseband scans are called "sub-2_ses-1_task-ultrasonicnoise_run-1_bold" where "N" is the subject number.

We named the bats by a specific number when they were first introduced to the colony.  
We simplified the naming of bats for readability in the text of Washington et al (2024) and its Supplemental Information.  
In these folders, the bat's subject data are listed by their actual, original numbers rather than their numbers in the text. 
However, it is easy to follow the change.

Text_Animal# --> Actual_Animal# --> Subject#

Bat1 --> Bat2  --> sub-2
Bat2 --> Bat6  --> sub-6
Bat3 --> Bat9  --> sub-9
Bat4 --> Bat10 --> sub-10
Bat5 --> Bat11 --> sub-11
Bat6 --> Bat12 --> sub-12
Bat7 --> Bat13 --> sub-13
Bat8 --> Bat14 --> sub-14
Bat9 --> Bat1  --> sub-1

*    Regarding Structural Scans   *
***********************************

Structural scans are in the folder "anat" for each subject.

Axial T2-weighted scans are "sub-N_ses-1_acq-axial_T2w" where "N" is the subject number.

Coronal T2-weighted scans are "sub-N_ses-1_acq-coronal_T2w" where "N" is the subject number.

"Axial" and "Coronal" are based on the "prone" position common in animal MRI studies, not the "supine" position common in human studies.
Thus, in the images in the "Axial" subfolder contains typically "coronal" images, and the "Coronal" subfolder contains "axial" images.    

We were able to get structural scans for 13 out of an original set of 15 bats.

Bats were assigned names and numbers before experiments were carried out.  

Technical difficulties prevented any successful scanning of "Bat_3 (sub-3)" or "Bat_8 (sub-8)".

There were no reported analyses performed on structural data except for the creation of a study-based template.

Thus the names of animals and numbers for structural scans are not as directly relevant to the results reported as are the functional scans.

The list of animals by name and number for structural scans follows the pattern above.

Animals that did not have functional scans but did have structural scans are labeled "NoF" (no functional) in the left column below.

Text_Animal# --> Actual_Animal# --> Subject#

Bat1 --> Bat2  --> sub-2
(No Bat3 --> No sub_3)
NoF  --> Bat4  --> sub-4
NoF  --> Bat5  --> sub-5
Bat2 --> Bat6  --> sub-6
NoF  --> Bat7  --> sub-7
(No Bat8 --> No sub_8)
Bat3 --> Bat9  --> sub-9
Bat4 --> Bat10 --> sub-10
Bat5 --> Bat11 --> sub-11
Bat6 --> Bat12 --> sub-12
Bat7 --> Bat13 --> sub-13
Bat8 --> Bat14 --> sub-14
Bat9 --> Bat1  --> sub-1
